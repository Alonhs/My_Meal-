# My_Meal-
A web application that allows employees to order lunch from predefined menu
 #    Assumptions:
#    1.	It will have to communicate with the restaurants ordering web app/system, to deliver food requests and get responds back, so we        need to support diverse data format types.
#    2.	will need security layers, application security, encryption, authentication to secure from web threats/cyber Attacks.
#    3.	The deadline for project delivery is short, so I need a fast programming language and framework (less code and configuration)          that can give me response for requests.
#     Decisions:
#    1.	I chose Python as a programming language (less code write).
#    2.	I chose Flask as a framework/API to meet the requirements, (the other option was to use Django Framework, which requires a lot of time setting configuration). 
#    3.	 To get more security features I added Flask-Security (micro framework) to quickly add common security mechanisms. 
#    4.	I added Flas#  k-RESTful (en expansion for Flask) to support requests: 
#       a.	different data format types, 
#       b.	application security-RESTful API can be parametrized/configured securely.
#       c.	Flask-RESTful for support ORM for deferent Data bases
#       d.	ORM can all so helps to distinguish data from code, application security for Injections (SQL, OS and etc).
#    5.	Runn the Application Over HTTPS â€“ to get encryption login sessions (PKI) with user.
